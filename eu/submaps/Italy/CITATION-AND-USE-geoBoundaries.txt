geoBoundaries: A global database of political administrative boundaries. 
PLoS ONE 15(4): e0231866. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231866. 

Users using individual boundary files from geoBoundaries should additionally
ensure that they are citing the sources provided in the metadata for each file.
 
====================================================
Column Definitions
====================================================
boundaryID - A unique ID created for every boundary in the geoBoundaries database by concatenating ISO 3166-1 3 letter country code, boundary level, geoBoundaries version, and an ID based on the geometry.
boundaryISO -  The ISO 3166-1 3-letter country codes for each boundary.
boundaryYear - The year(s) for which a boundary is representative. In cases where this is a range, the format is 'DATE-START TO DATE-END'.
boundaryType - The type of boundary defined (i.e., ADM0 is equivalent to a country border; ADM1 a state.  Levels below ADM1 can vary in definition by country.)
boundarySource - The name of the sources for the boundary definition used (with most boundaries having two identified sources).
boundaryLicense - The specific license the data is released under.
licenseDetail - Any details necessary for the interpretation or use of the license noted.
licenseSource - A URL declaring the license under which a data product is made available.
boundarySourceURL -  A URL from which source data was retrieved.
sourceDataUpdateDate - A date encoded following ISO 8601 (Year-Month-Date) describing the last date this boundary was updated, for use in programmatic updating based on new releases.
buildDate - The date the geoBoundary files were generated.
downloadURL - A URL from which the geoBoundary can be downloaded.
shapeID - The boundary ID, followed by the letter `B' and a unique integer for each shape which is a member of that boundary.
shapeName - The identified name for a given shape.  '' if not identified.
shapeGroup - The country or similar organizational group that a shape belongs to, in ISO 3166-1 where relevant.
shapeType - The type of boundary represented by the shape.
shapeISO - ISO codes for individual administrative districts, where available.  Where possible, these conform to ISO 3166-2, but this is not guaranteed in all cases. 'None' if not identified.
boundaryCanonical - Canonical name(s) for the administrative hierarchy represented.  Present where available.
